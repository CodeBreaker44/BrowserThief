# BrowserThief
All in one Rubber Ducky/BadUSB that runs a powershell script to extract and steal browser-saved passwords and stash them at your Flask web server. It currently extract passwords from **Opera/OperaGX/Chrome**, I will be adding support for more browsers like Firefox soon!

## Features
- The powershell script runs in-memory and avoids writing to disk which evades Windows Defender detection
- Powershell execution policy doesn't affect it whatsoever
- Includes an arduino RubberDucky script that runs in less than 2 seconds
- Extracts Passwords from all Chrome Profiles, Opera and OperaGX
- Will be adding Firefox soon

```
- Or you can use the rubber ducky for stealth/speed
	- Needs an Arduino that supports `<Keyboard.h>` (Nano, Leonardo)
	- Install Arduino IDE from their [website](https://wiki-content.arduino.cc/en/software)
	- Open `RubberDuckyScript.ino` using the IDE and replace `https://dump.silvercryptor.xyz` with your IP, check out [Setup](https://github.com/ScribblerCoder/BrowserThief#Setup) to setup the Web server
